Make sure this script is in the same directory as your C++ solution file and input folder.

This script will create a new output folder and generate all the output files corresponding to each input file from your C++ solution.

Changes you can make:

In the first line you can change the "temp.cpp" to your own C++ solution file name (Make sure it doesnot contain spaces).

In the for loop the range which is set to 0 to 0 can be changed to anything like 0 to X where X is the ID of your last input file. Example: If your last input file is "input15.txt" the loop will go from 0 to 15. 

If your input files are not in the forma input00.txt, input01.txt,.. make sure to change the script accordingly.
