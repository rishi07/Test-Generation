To run the script, open terminal and type "bash testscript.sh".

Make sure testfile.cpp and testscript.sh are in the same directory.

This will create an "input" folder in the same directory which will contain the input files.

You can change the constraints in the testfile.cpp to generate your own testcases.

You may change MAX to change the maximum number of nodes that can exist in any testcase, currently set to 100005.
You may change the time seed which is currently set to 0.
You may change the number of testcases which is currently set to 5.
According to number of testcases you can change the value of number of nodes for each testfile in the nodes[] array.
Also, there are two ways of printing the edge list of a tree you can use the either one by commenting out the other.
